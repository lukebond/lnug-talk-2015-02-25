## WHY I BUILT PAZ

About a year ago I wanted to solve two problems:
1. A web front-end to CoreOS' Fleet functionality
2. Reduce the pain of multi-host Docker networking

So I built Paz: a self-hosted Docker PaaS based on CoreOS
and Fleet, written in Node.js.

I'll give a very brief explanation for those who aren't
familiar with Docker, CoreOS and Fleet.

---

## FLEET

Fleet is an abstraction to systemd at the cluster rather
than host level.

systemd is a Linux init system, like upstart, etc. You use
it to declare how services are run on a Linux system.

With systemd you say to a host "I declare service N, it is
started like so, and I want you to restart it if it dies".

With Fleet you say this to a cluster.

systemd stores its data on disk on the host. Fleet stores it
in a distributed data store called Etcd. Ultimately Fleet
boils down to just running stuff for you with systemd on
your hosts, coordinated by Etcd.

You interact with Fleet via a CLI, telling it to start and
stop services, view their logs, check their status, etc.
Just like systemd.

It's crying out for a nice web interface to do all of this.

## MULTI-HOST DOCKER NETWORKING

This has been a hot topic in Docker since the initial hype.

The initial reaction to Docker:
_"Wow so I can spin up reproduceable vertical stacks quickly
_and easily. Eliminating concerns about portability and host
_configuration/compatibility. [Chef|Puppet|Poverty|Cancer]
_is dead!"

Later, in production:
_"Whoa hang on a second. How the hell do I discover and link
_all these containers? And why is there still
_[Chef|Puppet|Poverty|Cancer] in the world???"

When new technology makes once-hard things easy, we very
quickly forget those hard things.

Then we blame this new technology for revealing the next
barrier!

There is a debate over whether or not the Docker tool
should be solving this problem. I refer you to the case of
Docker vs Rocket and the debate about Docker plugins.

The reality is that Docker does not currently solve multi-
host networking between containers for you out of the box.

## WHAT IS PAZ?

* Paz is your own private PaaS that you can host anywhere
* Paz runs anywhere you can run CoreOS
  * Vagrant/VirtualBox, DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.
  * Run it on your laptop or "in the cloud"
* Paz makes it easy to get started with Docker on CoreOS
* Paz is accessible due to its simplicity
  * Underneath it's "just" Fleet and Docker
* Paz is a nice user-interface on top of Fleet
* Paz gives you zero-downtime-deployments
* Paz has a PaaS-inspired workflow designed for CD
  * e.g. Git push -> CI -> deploy
* Paz can be used like a multi-host Dokku
* Paz is like your own private Heroku
* Paz doesn't care what CI system you use
* Paz doesn't care what your apps are written in
  * As long as you containerise them
  * Yes this means any language on any Linux distro
* Paz is composed of:
  * Three small Node.js API services
  * Some dynamically-configured HAProxy services
  * Some `cloud-config`
  * A beautiful Ember.js front-end designed by @jongold

---

## WHY MIGHT YOU WANT TO USE IT?

With Paz you can:
* Host your apps and services
* Quickly set up a prod-like development cluster
  * In VirtualBox/Vagrant or "in the cloud"
  * Useful for load-testing for e.g.
* Connect services together across hosts
  * e.g. three webapp instances and a database
* Automate your dev workflow: commit -> CI -> deploy
* Declare your services and have Paz keep them running
* Get started with Docker, Fleet, Etcd and CoreOS gently
* Focus on building your apps

Plus, don't you know Node.js & Docker are a perfect match?
* Docker best-practice is a single process per container
  * Node.js apps are single-process!
* Microservices are perfectly suited to Docker
  * Node.js is perfect for microservices!

---

## HOW IT WORKS

* Declare your services in the UI
* They get stored in the "service directory"
* The "scheduler" is the service that deploys things
* You can manually tell the scheduler to deploy
* Or have it triggered at the end of your CI process
  * Paz supports the post-push Docker Hub webhooks
* Using Etcd and some HAProxy plumbing your containers
  are linked together
* There is some basic support for configuring DNS for
  externally-facing services

---

## CURRENT STATUS OF PAZ

* I presented Paz at Container Camp in September 2014
* I'd hoped to release it by the end of 2014
  * But I suffered from burnout and took a break
* Since then Paz has been a closed-source project
  * With the intention of polishing before an OS release
* This is what I've been doing in 2015
  * This has meant removing some half-finished features
  * Such as "environments", sadly (but it will be back)
* Installation process & documentation need improvement
* Once it's open-sourced I'll need users and contributors!

-----

## THE "SPECIAL TREAT"

* As I said, I'd hoped to open-source Paz in December
* But I felt it wasn't ready
* I think this was a mistake

So, in the spirit of open-source software...

## WHAT NOW?

* I'll be leading and maintaining this project with
  renewed vigour and some help from fellow YLDers
* I need your help with the following:
  * Use it, file issues when you have problems
  * Hack on it, send Pull Requests with improvements
  * Tell me where the documentation is lacking
  * Discuss your use cases with us in order to help
    steer the project in the direction its users want

Let's make Paz the go-to PaaS project for the Node.js
community. Use it for all your Docker microservice needs!
